## Code Guidelines

Code Guidelines are ever-evolving and difficult to ascertain, being for the most part discretionary. Here're some important details to give a good idea though on what direction we wish to take code:

 * We follow the [Rust API guidelines](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/api-guidelines).
 * Format code using rustfmt
 * Modules (refering to built-in asset importers and their respective code) should have a distinctive prefix appended to all files names.
 * Features Flags should be minimal and prefixed by respective module flags. They should be grouped together into minimal, default, and extra variants of the module.
 * test function names should begin with either 'test_' or 'external_'. External requires that the tester brings in extra exterior files. The name should be followed by the module name.
